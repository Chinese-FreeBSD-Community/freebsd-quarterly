This report covers FreeBSD related projects for the period between July
and September, and is the third of four planned reports for 2020.

This quarter had quite a lot of work done, including but certainly not
limited to, in areas relating to everything from multiple architectures
such as x86, aarch64 and riscv for both base and ports, over kernel
changes such as vectored aio, routing lookups and multipathing, an 
alternative random(4) implementation, zstd integration for kernel
dumps, log compression, zfs and preparations for pkg(8), along with
wifi changes, changes to the toolchain like the new elfctl utility,  
and all the way to big changes like the git migration and moving the
documentation from DocBook to AsciiDoctor/Hugo, as well as many other
things too numerous to mention in an introduction.

This report with 45 entries couldn't have happened without all the
people doing the work also writing an entry for the report, so the
quarterly team would like to thank them, as otherwise, we wouldn't 
have anything to do.

Please note that the deadline for submissions covering the period
between January and March is March 31st.

We hope you'll enjoy reading as much as we enjoyed compiling it.
Daniel Ebdrup Jensen, on behalf of the quarterly team.
