## IP Routing lookup improvements ##

Link:	 [Add modular routing lookup framework.](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D27401)

Contact: Alexander Chernikov <melifaro@FreeBSD.org>  

This work adds a fib lookup framework, allowing to attach custom IP lookup algorithms to any routing table on the fly. It allows to use more performant and efficient lookup algorithms, dynamically selected based on the number of routes in the routing table. Finally, it provides an implementation of modified DIR-24-8 for IPv4/IPv6, speeding IP lookups for the large-fib use case.

This work is a part of a larger effort to modernise the routing subsystem.

### Background ###

FreeBSD runs diverse workloads on both low-end and high-end devices, resulting in different networking/memory requirements for each case.
Small boxes with a couple of routes are different from routers with full-view.
IPv4 lookups are different from IPv6 ones. 
Conditions can change dynamically: one may easily reconfigure a system to receive full view instead of a default route.

Currently, FreeBSD uses radix (compressed binary tree) to perform all unicast route manipulations, including routing lookups.
Radix implementation requires storing key length in each item, allowing to use sockaddrs, transparently supporting virtually any address family.
This flexibility comes at a cost: radix is *relatively slow*, *cache-unfriendly* and adds *locking* to the hot path.
Finally, radix is closely coupled to the rest of the system, making it hard to switch to something else.

### Implementation overview ###

#### Overview ####

Modular fib IP lookup framework has been designed to address flexibility and performance requirements.

It keeps system radix as the "control plane" source of truth, simplifying actual algorithms implementation.
It allows dynamic load new algorithms as the kernel modules and abstracts most OS-specific details, reducing algorithm "glue" code.
It automatically adapts to the current system state by picking the best matching algorithm for the routing table on-the-fly.

The following algorithms are provided by default.

IPv4:

  * bsearch4 (lockless binary search in a specially-crafted IP array), tailored for small-fib (less than 16 routes)
  * radix4_lockless (lockless immutable radix, re-created on every routing table change), tailored for small-fib (less than 1000 routes)
  * radix4 (base system radix backend)
  * dpdk_lpm4 (DPDK DIR24-8-based lookups), lockless datastructure optimised for large-fib ( [D27412](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D27412) )

IPv6:

  * radix6_lockless: lockless immutable radix, re-created on every routing table change, tailored for small-fib (less than 1000 routes)
  * radix6: wrapper around existing system radix
  * dpdk_lpm6: DPDK DIR24-8-based lookups, lockless datastructure optimised for large-fib ( [D27412](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D27412) )

#### Performance changes ####

Micro benchmarks (i7-7660U, single-core lookups, 2048 destinations, benchmark code in [D27604](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D27604)).

IPv4:

  * 8 routes: radix4: ~20mpps, radix4_lockless: ~25mpps, bsearch4: ~69mpps, dpdk_lpm4: ~67 mpps
  * 700k routes: radix4_lockless: 3.3mpps, dpdk_lpm4: 46mpps

IPv6:

  * 8 routes: radix6_lockless: ~20mpps, dpdk_lpm6: ~70mpps
  * 100k routes: radix6_lockless: ~14mpps, dpdk_lpm6: ~57mpps

Forwarding performance:

  * +10-15% IPv4: small-fib, bsearch4
  * +25% IPv4: full-view, dpdk_lpm4
  * +20% IPv6: full-view, dpdk_lpm6
