The FreeBSD CI team maintains the continuous integration system
of the FreeBSD project.  The CI system firstly checks the committed changes
can be successfully built, then performs various tests and analysis over the
newly built results.
The artifacts from those builds are archived in the artifact server for
further testing and debugging needs.  The CI team members examine the
failing builds and unstable tests and work with the experts in that area to
fix the code or adjust test infrastructure.  The details of these efforts
are available in the [weekly CI reports](https://hackmd.io/@FreeBSD-CI).

During the fourth quarter of 2020, we continued working with the contributors and
developers in the project to fulfil their testing needs and also keep
collaborating with external projects and companies to improve their products
and FreeBSD.
