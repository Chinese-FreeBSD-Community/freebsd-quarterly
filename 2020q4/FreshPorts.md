FreshPorts, and its sister site, FreshSource, have reported
upon FreeBSD commits for 20 years. They cover all commits,
not just ports.

FreshPorts tracks the commits and extracts data from the
port Makefiles to create a database of information useful
to both port developers and port users.

For example, https://www.freshports.org/security/acme.sh/ shows
the history of this port, back to its creation in May 2017.

### git ###

The work to become git-ready is mostly complete. Both src and doc commits are
flowing into [devgit.freshports.org](https://devgit.freshports.org). Some
work is required on various issues, but nothing that stops the flow of
commits into the database.

### Help wanted ###

Amazon have donated enough to try FreshPorts on AWS. I need help with the
following:

  * getting IPv6 working
  * working with [RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/)

If you can help with this, please contact me. Thank you.

Thank you
