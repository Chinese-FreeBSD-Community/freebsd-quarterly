During the final quarter of 2020 three office hours sessions were held.

The first was hosted by the core team in a time slot conducive to Asia and
Australia, covering topics including the transition to git, recruiting for
project teams, and core's todo list.

The second was hosted by the git transition team, and answered attendee
questions about the transition to git and how it would impact the project's
workflows.

The third session was hosted by bhyve maintainers Peter Grehan and John Baldwin
to present recent development efforts and answer questions about bhyve.

The project is looking for volunteers to host future office hours sessions, as
well as taking topic suggestions. We also hope to improve the system to allow people
to submit questions ahead of time, so that we can take maximum advantage of
subject matter experts when we have them for these calls.

You can find the schedule for future office hours, and videos of past
office hours on the [FreeBSD Wiki](https://wiki.freebsd.org/OfficeHours)
