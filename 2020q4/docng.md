The Doc New Generation project is finished. The switch-over date will be Saturday, January 23rd.

The objective of using Hugo and AsciiDoctor is to reduce the
learning curve and let people to start quickly contributing to our documentation
system. Other benefits of using Hugo is that we can use other
technologies aside from AsciiDoctor, like MarkDown, RST, Pandoc, etc.

You can find a [work in progress on updating the FreeBSD Documentation Project Primer to Hugo/AsciiDoctor](https://github.com/sergio-carlavilla/documentation-project-primer).
