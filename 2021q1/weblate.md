After the doc migration to Hugo/AsciiDoctor the Weblate tool it's opened again.

There are three projects on our Weblate:

  * Documentation (Books and Articles) - open
  * FreeBSD Doc (Archived) - former project
  * Website - pending

Language teams that were using Weblate before the migration to
Hugo/AsciidDoctor, please see our Wiki [Translation based on Automatic
Suggestions](https://wiki.freebsd.org/DocTranslationOnWeblate#Translation_based_on_Automatic_Suggestions)
for more details.

We've just started the process to automatic translate strings into the new
project, using the Machine Translation feature with translations from the
former project. This will save time for our translators.

There are still pending things, you can check the [Status
Page](https://wiki.freebsd.org/DocTranslationOnWeblate#Status), any help is
very welcome.

The next step for the new quarter is to prepare and release the Website
translations through Weblate as well.
