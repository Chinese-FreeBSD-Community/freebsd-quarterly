Contact: Ka Ho Ng <khng@FreeBSD.org>  

This work presents a number of ioctl commands on [.underline]#/dev/sndstat# using nv(9) to expose all available audio 
device nodes. nv(9) is used to generate a serialized binary stream representation of the information of audio device nodes 
presented in the running system. The documented nvlist structure in sndstat(4) manual page is stable for programming use.

For long time, enumerating the audio device node interface requires parsing content of [.underline]#/dev/sndstat#. It is 
tedious to write such parser and handles different `hw.snd.verbose` levels correctly. Using nv(9) eliminates the need of 
writing a text parser to do audio device nodes enumeration.

This work has been committed and is available starting from FreeBSD version number 1400006.
