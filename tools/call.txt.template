Dear FreeBSD Community,

The deadline for the next FreeBSD Quarterly Status update is
%%DEADLINE%% for work done since the last round of Quarterly Reports:
%%START%% %%YEAR%% - %%STOP%% %%YEAR%%.
I would like to remind you that reports are collected during the last
month of every quarter.

Status report submissions do not need to be very long.  They may be
about anything happening in the FreeBSD project and community, and
they provide a great way to inform FreeBSD users and developers about
work that is underway or has been completed. Report submissions are
not limited to committers; anyone doing anything interesting and
FreeBSD related can -- and should -- write one!

The preferred method is to follow the guidelines at the Quarterly
GitHub repository:

https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd-quarterly

Alternatively you can fetch the AsciiDoctor template, fill it in, and
email it to quarterly-submissions@FreeBSD.org.
The new AsciiDoctor template can be found at:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/freebsd/freebsd-quarterly/master/report-sample.adoc

We look forward to seeing your %%YEAR%%Q%%QUARTER%% reports!

Thanks,

%%SIGNATURE%% (on behalf of quarterly@)
